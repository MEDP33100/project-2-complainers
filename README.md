## **Project Overview**

Our project visualizes NYC 311 complaint data from the past year using an interactive Leaflet map. By pulling live data from the NYC Open Data 311 Service Requests API, we show where common complaints—like noise, illegal parking, or heating issues—are concentrated across the five boroughs. Our goal was to present this information in a humorous yet meaningful way, drawing attention to New Yorkers’ everyday frustrations.

## **Features**

Borough Filter - Users can filter complaint data by borough using a dropdown menu.

Complaint Type Filter - Users can filter by broad complaint categories like noise or illegal parking. This helps narrow the view to specific problem types.

Toggle Marker Clustering - Users can turn clustering on or off. When clustering is on, markers are grouped into colorful circles with random tooltip messages. When off, markers appear individually across the map.

Click Pins for More Info – Clicking a pin shows details like complaint type, borough, zip code, and date. Just a quick way to see what the complaint is about without filtering.
## **Technologies Used**

Leaflet.js—  interactive map 
Leaflet.markercluster — For clustering and tooltips
Express.js — Node.js server setup
Handlebars (hbs) — for rendering dynamic HTML
NYC Open Data 311 API — Live complaint data we pulled from
Glitch — for hosting the website



## **Future Enhancements**

_List any future enhancements you would like to make or improve given more time._
1. More types of data filtering
2. Heatmap to add more visuals - font size correlates to density of complaints.
